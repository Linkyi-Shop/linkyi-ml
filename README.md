# linkyi-ml

This is our Machine Learning Development repository for working in this capstone project. This repository store our `notebook.ipynb` that can be referred later as our implementation documentation. We implements Object Detection Model with transfer learning from MobileNetV2. The model is implemented to detect any harmful object in an image, so that it can be used in our mobile application.

## Prerequisite
